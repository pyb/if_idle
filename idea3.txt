Add a roguelike element?

Idle roguelike? What'd be the vision?

garrotte

How to prototype?

=> short descs a la zork
enemies/npcs walk around in loops, like zork monsters
hiding locations become visible if enemy

mix this with deathtrap dungeon world? ie magic/fantasy? or modern/tech? (a la Saboteur?)

---------

explore an early interaction in depth.

Hide in a 2-exit med size restaurant kitchen, a bad guy comes in
Hiding places : under table, crouch behind fridge, maybe grab onto ceiling near entrance door (no use if npc uses other entrance)

throw knives? shuriken ? garrote?


------

* Twine Sample:
You hear footsteps coming from the restaurant entrance. What do you do ?

Hide - crouch behind fridge - visibility 5% - manoeuver fast - exposed
Hide - crawl under work table - visibility 30% - manoeuver medium - half protected
