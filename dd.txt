Idea : Idle Deathtrap Dungeon
My "pilot project" for Canggu?
This ties 2 ideas that I had : idle IF, and and older idea where you teach behaviours, rather than directly handle movement, to solve levels

1) Build a classical-style game with twine

2) Automateable with a list of simple user-added, If-this-then-that commands:
"On CROSSROADS : LEFT". # Turn left at every crossroad
"On ANT : Attack" # kill all the ants

Goal The dungeon will be so deep, and death so frequent, that full automation via trial/error is necessary to win

-------------------

* Qs

Should there be character stats (and Gain strength and/or XP from reps/fights, which are also automatable)

----

* Meta Qs:

- Can I find a stronger idea still?


- Strat to rush this through?
-> can I create a little game first.

-> 

----

Idea: Part of the graph is Circular, designed to be traversed twice. With slightly different text / added on the second time

"Did you actually
enjoy writing them, when you were really banging
them out?
Steve Jackson:
Oh yeah. It was like doing and designing a dungeon on
graph paper, but doing it in a form that thousands of people would be
reading. "

"And I kept a map of
the whole thing. At home I've got all these hand-drawn maps the length
of this table as you go through the adventure. It took quite a long
time."

Design a dungeon!
