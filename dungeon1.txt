Rooms:

* Champion's Cave Entrance.

The flimsy awning is struggling to protect a little congregation from the brutal midday heat. Pulsing a stream of cool air, the opening in the rock face looks almost inviting, despite the dust and staleness, not to mention the extreme danger.

* Entrance / who
See above. Add dialogue

* The what
<Candidates walk into the dungeon. I enter in 3rd position>

* Starter packs

"Starter packs" [safety clue in the title!]

After a couple of minutes down this wide tunnel, you come to a wide, well-lit area with a little installation in the middle of the passage.
There is a table made of a pair of tresles and a strong sheet of wood. On it are a two bundles left. A bundle bearing your name.

[I'll look what's inside.]
[Absolutely do not touch this. Carry on.]

* First loot

In your bundle is a Gold Coin, a small bag of spicy Peanuts, and a Banana. You put these modest offerings in your rucksack and [Walk down the tunnel.]

* First Trap
-> Logic puzzle(s) a la "3 boxes"

"Boxy puzzle"

After a couple of turns in the tunnel, you quickly come across a large carved alcove on the right. It contains is your first puzzle.

In the sand are three boxes, and on the wall is a label.
It reads "One of the boxes always bears the truth.
   		  One of the boxes always bears falsity."

On the blue box is a sign : ""
The black box also bears a message : ""
Finally, the silver box says : ""

Despite the obvious signs of passage in the area, it looks as if that your competitors have left the boxes untouched.

-> [Open the Blue box]. [Open the Black box]. [Open the Silver box]. [Leave the boxes and move on]

<Reward : 5 gold pieces>

* First crossroads

"Choices..."

The air is getting cooler, but more humid.

Just as you were starting to hope, you come at a crossroads : there is a three-way split in the tunnel. Footsteps in the dusty ground show that your predecessors took the middle path and the right path, respectively.

[Take the Left path]
[Middle path]
[Right path]

CR1-> LP
* Left path 1st door

"A door to the left"

The left wall is interrupted by a metal-framed, thick wooden door, leading to a side room or tunnel.
You stop and listen for a few seconds. You hear some faint voices.

[Knock on the door]
[Simply open it|Gambling den]
[Ignore it and Carry on down the tunnel|Left path 2nd door]

* Knock on the <den> door

Nothing happens. Whoever is inside hasn't heard you, or doesn't care.

[Simply open the door|Gambling den]
[Ignore it and Carry on down the tunnel|Left path 2nd door]

* Gambling den

You open the door and have a peek. A game of cards is taking place here.
A jumble of unused kitchen equipment is stored along three walls of the room.
In the centre of the room is folding table and some chairs. Sitting on the chairs are four Goblins. They look at you curiously for an instant, but soon turn back to their cards.

[Close the door, and carry on down the tunnel|Left path 2nd door]
[Ask if you could join the game]
[Draw your sword and attack the nearest Goblin]


* Draw your sword...

With the advantage of surprise, you inflict a grievous neck wound upon[?] the first Goblin.
Soon enough, the other three draw their daggers. They're attacking you from three directions, and throwing various metal utensils at you.
You eventually overcome the small but fierce creatures, but this comes at the cost of <red>10 HP</red>. 

<Money reward>

Notes.

From reading DD:

Part of the fun is probably in mapping the dungeon



-----------

Stopping here, this isn't fun enough.

* What I liked about it ?

Writing descriptions
Maybe some dialogue? (haven't tried)
Writing off a map was v. useful to keep things manageable.

* What I didn't :

The situations I mapped are not that interesting / trite
I need a wider objective/idea to keep me writing the details of it, brick by brick
