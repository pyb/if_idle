Rooms:

* Champion's Cave Entrance.

A flimsy, hastily assembled awning is struggling to protect a little congregation from the brutal midday heat. Pulsing a whiff of cool air, the opening in the rock face looks almost inviting, despite the dust and staleness, not to mention the extreme danger.

* Entrance / who


* The what
<Enter in 3rd position>


* Starter packs

"Starter packs" [safety clue in the title!]

After a couple of minutes down this wide tunnel, you come to a well-lit widening that features a installation in the middle.
You find makeshift table made of a pair of tresles and a strong sheet of wood. On it are a couple of bundles left, one bearing your name.

[I'll look what's inside.]
[Absolutely do not touch this. Carry on.]

* First Trap
-> Logic puzzle(s) a la "3 boxes"

"Boxy puzzle"

After a couple of turns in the tunnel, you quickly come across a large carved alcove on the right. There is your first puzzle. Despite the obvious signs of passage in the area, it would appear that your competitors have left it untouched.

In the sand are three boxes, and on the wall is a label.
It reads "One of the boxes always bears the truth.
   		  One of the boxes always bears falsity."

On the blue box is a sign : ""
The black box also bears a message : ""
Finally, the silver box says : ""

-> [Open the Blue box]. [Open the Black box]. [Open the Silver box]. [Leave the boxes and move on]

<Reward : 5 gold pieces>

* First crossroads

"Choices..."

The air is getting cooler, but more humid.

As you were beginning to sense might happen, you come at a crossroads : there is a three-way split in the tunnel. Footsteps in the dusty ground show that your predecessors took the middle path and the right path, respectively.

[Take the Left path]
[Middle path]
[Right path]

"A door to the left"

The left wall is interrupted by a metal-framed, thick wooden door, leading to a side room or tunnel.

[Simply open it]
[Ignore it and Carry on down the tunnel]
